/** FORMATTED BUFFER PRINTING
 **
 **  bufprint() allows your to easily and safely append formatted string
 **  content to a given bounded character buffer, in a way that is easier
 **  to use than raw snprintf()
 **
 **  'buffer'  is the start position in the buffer,
 **  'buffend' is the end of the buffer, the function assumes (buffer <= buffend)
 **  'format'  is a standard printf-style format string, followed by any number
 **            of formatting arguments
 **
 **  the function returns the next position in the buffer if everything fits
 **  in it. in case of overflow or formatting error, it will always return "buffend"
 **
 **  this allows you to chain several calls to bufprint() and only check for
 **  overflow at the end, for exemple:
 **
 **     char   buffer[1024];
 **     char*  p   = buffer;
 **     char*  end = p + sizeof(buffer);
 **
 **     p = bufprint(p, end, "%s/%s", first, second);
 **     p = bufprint(p, end, "/%s", third);
 **     if (p >= end) ---> overflow
 **
 **  as a convenience, the appended string is zero-terminated if there is no overflow.
 **  (this means that even if p >= end, the content of "buffer" is zero-terminated)
 **
 **  vbufprint() is a variant that accepts a va_list argument
