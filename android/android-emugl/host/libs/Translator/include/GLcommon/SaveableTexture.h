// TextureGlobal is an auxiliary class when save and load a texture / EglImage.
// We need it only for texture because texture is the only GL object that can be
// shared globally (i.e. across guest processes) by wrapping it up in EglImage.

// Lifespan:
// When saving a snapshot, TextureGlobal should be populated in the pre-save
// stage, save data in save stage and get destroyed right after that.
// When loading from a snapshot, TextureGlobal will be populated and restoring
// hardware texture before restoring any EglImage or GLES texture handles.
// EglImages and GLES textures get their global handles from TextureGlobal when
// EglImages and GLES textures are being loaded. Then TextureGlobal will be
// destroyed.
