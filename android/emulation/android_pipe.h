ANDROID_BEGIN_HEADER

// TECHNICAL NOTE:
//
// An Android pipe is a very fast communication channel between the guest
// system and the emulator program.
//
// To open a new pipe to the emulator, a guest client will do the following:
//
//     fd = open("/dev/qemu_pipe", O_RDWR);
//     ret = write(fd, pipeServiceName, strlen(pipeServiceName) + 1);
//     if (ret < 0) {
//         // something bad happened, see errno
//     }
//
// Where 'pipeServiceName' is a string that looke like "pipe:<service>"
// or "pipe:<service>:<args>", terminated by a zero.
//
//     now read()/write() to communicate with <pipeServiceName> service in the
//     emulator. select() and non-blocking i/o will also work properly.
//

// The Goldfish pipe virtual device is in charge of communicating with the
// kernel to manage pipe operations.
//
//
//
//
// This header provides the interface used by pipe services in the emulator
// to receive new client connection and deal with them.
//
//
// 1/ Call android_pipe_service_add() to register a new pipe service by name.
//    This must provide a pointer to a series of functions that will be called
//    during normal pipe operations.
//
// 2/ When a client connects to the service, the 'init' callback will be called
//    to create a new service-specific client identifier (which must be
//    returned by the function).
//
// 3/ Call android_pipe_close() to force the closure of a given pipe. Note
//    that this takes the 'hwpipe' parameter that was passed to init().
//
// 4/ Call android_pipe_wake() to signal a change of state to the pipe.
//    Note that this also takes the 'hwpipe' parameter from init().
//
//

// Buffer descriptor for sendBuffers() and recvBuffers() callbacks.

// The set of methods implemented by an AndroidPipe instance.
// All these methods are called at runtime by the virtual device
// implementation. Note that transfers are always initiated by the virtual
// device through the sendBuffers() and recvBuffers() callbacks.
//
// More specifically:
//
// - When a pipe has data for the guest, it should signal it by calling
//   'android_pipe_wake(pipe, PIPE_WAKE_READ)'. The guest kernel will be
//   signaled and will later initiate a recvBuffers() call.
//
// - When a pipe is ready to accept data from the guest, it should signal
//   it by calling 'android_pipe_wake(pipe, PIPE_WAKE_WRITE)'. The guest
//   kernel will be signaled, and will later initiate a sendBuffers()
//   call when the guest client writes data to the pipe.
//
// - Finally, the guest kernel can signal whether it wants to be signaled
//   on read or write events by calling the wakeOn() callback.
//
// - When the emulator wants to close a pipe, it shall call
//   android_pipe_close(). This signals the guest kernel which will later
//   initiate a close() call.
