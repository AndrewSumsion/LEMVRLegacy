PROGRAM_DESCRIPTION=\
"A script that tries to make you merge life slightly easier.

It does this by:

Figuring out which individual commits to merge in to get to the destination tag.
Next it will merge in every Xth commit, and trying to build the repo.

If this fails, you will have to fix the build and manually resolve the merge.

Depending on your appetite for risk you can set the steps parameter to skip
commits, this will decrease the number of merges, but might make it harder to
resolve conflicts.
