# GLES 3.x functions required by the translator library.
# Right now, this is only use to get glGetStringi() from the host GL library
# in order to deal with the fact that glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS) is obsolete
# in OpenGL 3.0, and some drivers don't implement it anymore (i.e. the
# function just returns NULL).
